      ## what is Markdown?
      see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
      
      > Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".
